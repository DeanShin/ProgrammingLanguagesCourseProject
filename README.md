## Run instructions

With python version >3.9.10, run the following command in the terminal:
`python3 main.py <input_file_path> <output_file_path>`
where `input_file_path` and `output_file_path` are the filepaths to the file that you want the scanner to scan, and the filepath that you want output to be written to, respectively.
